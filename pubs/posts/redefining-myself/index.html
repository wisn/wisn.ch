                    Today is February 7th, 2025. It has been about four years
                    since I graduated from my undergraduate studies, which means
                    I'm in my mid-twenties. This is a good time to reflect on
                    myself and redefine my goals in life. I will talk about my
                    passions, interests, and career, how life has been so far,
                    and what I want to do in the next few years.

                <h2>Doing Something That I Love</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was a kid, I have been really into computers. At
                    first, I used it to play video games. However, after some
                    time, I ended up learning many exciting things with it.
                    Starting from learning how to do office work, learning how
                    to edit photos & videos, learning how to produce music,
                    learning how to hack/crack software, learning how to code,
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have explored quite a number of things in this (computer)
                    field alone. From all of the things that I have explored,
                    I'm somehow really interested in programming. That feeling
                    when I can build my own world inside a device like a
                    computer is addicting. I suppose I really love building &
                    tinkering. It is even more exciting when I'm pursuing my
                    undergraduate informatics degree. I get to know computer
                    science in general in which I get to know about programming,
                    computer networks, database systems, distributed systems,
                    artificial intelligence, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for programming turned me into a software engineer.
                    In software engineering, we do a lot more than just
                    programming. That's why this role is quite fun for me. When
                    working on something, we need to think a lot. Not just
                    typing some codes. For example, let's say that we are
                    working on a new feature for our software. The things that
                    we need to do is to write down the requirements, do some
                    assessment, think about the design of the system, make sure
                    the timeline is okay, plan how we test and ship the
                    software, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's been many years since the first time I code to build a
                    product as a software engineer. At first, I'm doing a
                    software engineering part-time job to get some money while
                    also doing something that I like. My current area of work in
                    this field is mostly backend engineering and a little bit of
                    data engineering. Other than these two, I also have some
                    experience in frontend engineering and a bit of mobile
                    development. I also know a little bit about DevOps. After
                    trying so many things, I started to wonder whether software
                    engineering was for me. I mean, is this something that I
                    want to do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be fair, I'm enjoying my time working as a software
                    engineer. However, since this is professional work,
                    sometimes the task given to me is good and sometimes it
                    bores me. I need to allocate some of my free time to
                    exploring or doing something else that I like. Most of the
                    recent explorations that I did are exploring more about Web3
                    and distributed ledger technology such as blockchain and
                    hashgraph. Apparently, there are many interesting things
                    happening in this space. The last time I heard about Bitcoin
                    and Ethereum was when degenerates trying to sell their
                    overpriced NFT with a weird monkey picture on it. So, yeah,
                    a really good development progress I would say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The joy that I felt when exploring something new, thinking
                    of possibilities that may be possible with it, and solving
                    my own problems with it, is such an eye-opener for me. It
                    turns out that this is something that I really love.
                    Exploring, experimenting, and solving/building something
                    that <b>I want to</b> solve/build. Yes, the keywords are, I
                    want to do something that I want to. I'm now wondering
                    whether being a researcher or a computer scientist will be
                    the right one for me. The other possibility is to bootstrap
                    my own company. Or maybe, just hop on to another company
                    when I'm starting to get bored? Well, I don't know! At the
                    very least, I now know that I have the best result when I'm
                    working for myself.

                <h2>Sorting Out My Current Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    I have many interests. Is that not a good thing? Yes and no.
                    This is my biggest problem. I got interested in many things.
                    That means it is pretty difficult for me to focus on just
                    one thing. It is time for me to sort this out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, I'm most interested in computer science. I want
                    to keep exploring many things in this field. However, I need
                    to limit what to learn/explore to make sure that I get a
                    strong knowledge in a particular area before I can do
                    anything else. Since my main goal is to build something that
                    at least solves my own problem, I will start by choosing the
                    right programming language for me. I need to master one as
                    my main programming language. My ideal programming language
                    would be one that is like C, but a better version. Some of
                    the qualities that I'm looking for are a simple programming
                    language that can be compiled even decades later (or even a
                    century), low-level programming support (such as manual
                    memory management), a verified/correct compiler, able to
                    target many architectures/platforms (especially WebAssembly
                    &amp; *NIX-like operating systems), and joyful to use. I
                    already have some candidates for this. I already have some
                    candidates for this. I will write another post later about
                    my chosen programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than programming, there is another technology that I'm
                    interested in. It is the Web3 technology. When talking about
                    Web3, of course, I'm also interested in distributed ledger
                    technology such as blockchain, directed acyclic graph, and
                    hashgraph. There are many interesting projects that are
                    worth exploring as well. Some of them are decentralized
                    storage, decentralized computing, decentralized identity,
                    etc. The reason why I want a programming language that can
                    compile to WebAssembly is because I want to build something
                    on top of these blockchain projects. That's because many
                    projects are using WebAssembly as their (smart contract)
                    runtime. Thus, it is ideal to use a programming language
                    with built-in WASM support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I'm interested in blockchain technologies, I'm also
                    interested in the concept of cryptocurrency. More
                    specifically, the concept of an open economy in the digital
                    space by leveraging blockchain technology. However, since
                    many blockchain projects have a gas fee concept, even if it
                    is cheap, I think it will be the main factor that hinders
                    mass adoption. To solve this issue, I'm exploring some
                    projects with a feeless concept. Meaning that the user is
                    not required to pay for gas fees when sending some assets
                    (and when interacting with the smart contract). Any feeless
                    mechanism is okay as long as the user is not required to pay
                    for the gas fee. Some of the projects use reverse-gas model
                    (like Internet Computer [$ICP]), rechargeable energy model
                    (like TRON [$TRX]), gasless through fee granting concept
                    (like XION [$XION]), etc. I will write another post to talk
                    about this later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do have another interest outside of computer science.
                    However, I think it is better to focus on programming first.
                    Later, after I have mastered my preferred programming
                    language, I will continue building something in the Web3
                    space while revisiting software engineering. I hope I can
                    build whatever I want to build.

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, I want to move overseas either to work
                    or to study. One of the reasons is for me to experience
                    how's the life in a first-world country looks like. I have
                    this kind of motivation because I'm living in a developing
                    country right now. I'm doing fairly fine and living pretty
                    comfortably. However, living in a first-world country will
                    give me a good experience and may give me another
                    perspective in life. Thus, I will do some preparation for
                    this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While preparing to move out, I will also use my time to
                    build something. I want to build my own blogging platform
                    with some twists. To build a blogging platform, I need to
                    make sure that users are able to register and post something
                    themselves. This is important for me since I will be one of
                    the users too. I need to make sure that the users are safe
                    from any kind of cyber attack. I also want the contents
                    generated by the users to persists as long as possible. The
                    concept of permanent website will be used. Well, better for
                    me to write the detail later in a separate post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing is free in this world. That means I need to build a
                    payment system for my own product (or platform). For
                    example, if I want to build a paid blogging platform, I need
                    a payment system before letting the users do anything on my
                    platform. Of course, I can use existing solutions. However,
                    while I'm at it, I want to build a feeless ecosystem in the
                    Web3 space for this payment system. This will allow me to
                    have a company with fully on-chain economic activities. I
                    will tell you later in another post why I'm obsessing over
                    this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than a payment system, a common system that is being
                    used everywhere is an identity system. This identity system
                    can be used to give an identity to everything. I may give an
                    identity to a service inside my platform. I may also give an
                    identity to the user who uses my platform. Thus, I plan to
                    build something related to this as well. I will build
                    something that follows the W3C Decentralized Identifier
                    (DID) standard. Well, let's save it for some other time.
