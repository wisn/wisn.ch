                    Today is February 7th, 2025. It has been about four years
                    since I graduated from my undergraduate studies, which means
                    I'm in my mid-twenties. This is a good time to reflect on
                    myself and redefine my goals in life. I will talk about my
                    passions, interests, and career, how life has been so far,
                    and what I want to do in the next few years.

                <h2>Doing Something That I Really Love</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was a kid, I have been really into computer. At
                    first, I use it to play video games. However, after some
                    time, I ended up learning many exciting things with it.
                    Starting from learning how to do office work, learning how
                    to edit photos & videos, learning how to produce musics,
                    learning how to hack/crack softwares, learning how to code,
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have explored quite a number of things in this (computer)
                    field alone. From all of the things that I have explored,
                    I'm somehow really interested in programming. That feeling
                    when I can build my own world inside a device like a
                    computer is addicting. I suppose I really love building &
                    tinkering. It is even more exciting when I'm pursuing my
                    undergraduate informatics degree. I get to know computer
                    science in general in which I get to know about programming,
                    computer networks, database systems, distributed systems,
                    artificial intelligence, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for programming turned me into a software engineer.
                    In software engineering, we do a lot more than just
                    programming. That's why this role is quite fun for me. When
                    working on something, we need to think a lot. Not just
                    typing some codes. For example, let's say that we are
                    working on a new feature for our software. The things that
                    we need to do is to write down the requirement, doing some
                    assessment, thinking about the design of the system, make
                    sure the timeline is okay, planning how we test and ship the
                    software, etc.
