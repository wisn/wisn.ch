                    Today is February 7th, 2025. It has been about four years
                    since I graduated from my undergraduate studies, which means
                    I'm in my mid-twenties. This is a good time to reflect on
                    myself and redefine my goals in life. I will talk about my
                    passions, interests, and career, how life has been so far,
                    and what I want to do in the next few years.

                <h2>Doing Something That I Love</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was a kid, I have been really into computers. At
                    first, I used it to play video games. However, after some
                    time, I ended up learning many exciting things with it.
                    Starting from learning how to do office work, learning how
                    to edit photos & videos, learning how to produce music,
                    learning how to hack/crack software, learning how to code,
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have explored quite a number of things in this (computer)
                    field alone. From all of the things that I have explored,
                    I'm somehow really interested in programming. That feeling
                    when I can build my own world inside a device like a
                    computer is addicting. I suppose I really love building &
                    tinkering. It is even more exciting when I'm pursuing my
                    undergraduate informatics degree. I get to know computer
                    science in general in which I get to know about programming,
                    computer networks, database systems, distributed systems,
                    artificial intelligence, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for programming turned me into a software engineer.
                    In software engineering, we do a lot more than just
                    programming. That's why this role is quite fun for me. When
                    working on something, we need to think a lot. Not just
                    typing some codes. For example, let's say that we are
                    working on a new feature for our software. The things that
                    we need to do is to write down the requirements, do some
                    assessment, think about the design of the system, make sure
                    the timeline is okay, plan how we test and ship the
                    software, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's been many years since the first time I code to build a
                    product as a software engineer. At first, I'm doing a
                    software engineering part-time job to get some money while
                    also doing something that I like. My current area of work in
                    this field is mostly backend engineering and a little bit of
                    data engineering. Other than these two, I also have some
                    experience in frontend engineering and a bit of mobile
                    development. I also know a little bit about DevOps. After
                    trying so many things, I started to wonder whether software
                    engineering was for me. I mean, is this something that I
                    want to do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be fair, I'm enjoying my time working as a software
                    engineer. However, since this is professional work,
                    sometimes the task given to me is good and sometimes it
                    bores me. I need to allocate some of my free time to
                    exploring or doing something else that I like. Most of the
                    recent explorations that I did are exploring more about Web3
                    and distributed ledger technology such as blockchain and
                    hashgraph. Apparently, there are many interesting things
                    happening in this space. The last time I heard about Bitcoin
                    and Ethereum was when degenerates trying to sell their
                    overpriced NFT with a weird monkey picture on it. So, yeah,
                    a really good development progress I would say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The joy that I felt when exploring something new, thinking
                    of possibilities that may be possible with it, and solving
                    my own problems with it, is such an eye-opener for me. It
                    turns out that this is something that I really love.
                    Exploring, experimenting, and solving/building something
                    that <b>I want to</b> solve/build. Yes, the keyword is, I
                    want to do something that I want to. I'm now wondering
                    whether being a researcher or a computer scientist will be
                    the right one for me. The other possibility is to bootstrap
                    my own company. Or maybe, just hop on to another company
                    when I'm starting to get bored? Well, I don't know!
