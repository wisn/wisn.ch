                <p>Hi!</p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal notes on the web! My full name is
                    Wisnu Adi Nurcahyo. Some of my friends call me Wis, Nu,
                    Wisnu, or
                    <b>wisn</b>. That "wisn" is my online handle so some people
                    started to call me by that name. I do prefer to be called
                    "wisn" since it is quite a unique name. Well, you know,
                    "Wisnu" is a common name here in my country. Having a unique
                    call name is great.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working as a full-time software engineer in
                    an online travel agent company. One of the big ones in my
                    country. I have been working full-time professionally in
                    this field for about four years (as of the first quarter of
                    2025). I have many things that I want to note (or write)
                    related to this field. Anything related (but not limited) to
                    computer science, programming, software engineering,
                    software architecture, distributed ledger technology, math,
                    and so on. I can note everything privately. However, I think
                    it would be better to just share it online. By doing that, I
                    hope it is useful to anyone who reads it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that all of the things that I have posted online
                    (especially on this particular website) are my own views. I
                    did not represent any organization. With that being said,
                    please enjoy your stay here. Hopefully, I can publish many
                    good things here.
                </p>
