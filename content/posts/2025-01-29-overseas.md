Today, when I'm writing this, is a rather important day for me and for many people in my country.
We talk a lot about our president's first 100 days of his presidency.
Including his vice president of course but people (including me) don't really care about him.
Well, we will not talk about the president or the vice president specifically because, you know, the focus is on the government under their rules.
I have been following many updates related to many things.
Starting from how's the government doing, how's the law enforcement doing, and even how's the citizens themselves doing.
So far, based on many factors, my verdict for their first 100 days work performance is **just to work overseas**.
I mean, us, the citizens, better to just move out from this country.

We have been talking quite a bit about the rulers. Who are they?
Well, I will not say who are they or from which country I am.
If you know, you know.

# Why Am I Staying in the First Place?

To be honest, I have been planning to move overseas for a while now.
My goal was to get a job and then move out.
Or, maybe, pursue a postgraduate degree outside.
However, my parents are reluctant to let me go.
I also have a girlfriend so I need to have an approval from her since I can't bring her.
Having a long distance relationship overseas will be quite difficult for both of us.
Thus, I'm staying a bit longer.
